## Introduction

Maternity Care Modeling is an interdisciplinary field that combines healthcare, data science, and artificial intelligence to enhance the understanding and prediction of various aspects of pregnancy and childbirth. This includes predicting pregnancy outcomes, such as complications or the likelihood of a successful pregnancy, as well as predicting the mode of delivery, whether it's vaginal or through a cesarean section (C-section).

### Significance

Pregnancy and childbirth are among the most transformative and crucial experiences in an individual's life. Maternity care plays a pivotal role in ensuring the well-being of both the expectant parent and the unborn child. By leveraging advanced data analysis and predictive modeling, we can:

- Improve Healthcare Decision-Making: Healthcare professionals can benefit from accurate predictions to make informed decisions about prenatal care, interventions, and delivery methods.
- Enhance Patient Care: Pregnant individuals can receive personalized care plans based on their unique risks and characteristics, leading to improved health outcomes and reduced maternal and neonatal mortality rates.
- Resource Allocation: Hospitals and healthcare systems can allocate resources more efficiently by identifying high-risk pregnancies in advance, reducing the burden on overtaxed healthcare facilities.


## Objective

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

- Predict pregnancy outcomes (e.g., complications) using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- Predict the mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean section) for pregnant patients.

We believe that Maternity Care Modeling has the potential to make a significant positive impact on the lives of expectant parents and their children.
